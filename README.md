This is a dummy Laravel project setup using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail) for local development. It is intended for testing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and automating workflows such as running tests and performing static analysis with PHPStan.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jeet1293/lara_action.git
    cd lara_action
    ```

2. Install Composer Dependencies:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php83-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
    ```

3. Build the Docker containers using Sail:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

   This will start the Docker containers in detached mode. Sail sets up services like the web server, database, etc., using Docker.

4. Configure environment variables:

    ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
    ```
   Please make the necessary change(i.e. Generate the application key)

5. Run the Laravel application:
   Open your browser and go to:

    ```plaintext
    http://localhost
    ```

   You should see the Laravel welcome page.

#### Running Artisan Commands

You can run Laravel Artisan commands within the Docker container by prefixing them with `./vendor/bin/sail`. For example, to run migrations:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller MyController
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:Model MyModel
```

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow in this project automates tasks such as running tests and performing static analysis. It runs two primary jobs:

1. **Run Tests** - This job installs dependencies, prepares the Laravel application, and runs the tests using PHPUnit.
2. **Run Static Analysis** - This job installs dependencies and runs static analysis with PHPStan to check for code quality issues.

### Workflow Configuration

The workflow is triggered on:

- **Push** events to the `main` branch.
- **Pull Request** events targeting the `main` branch, specifically for changes to `.php` and `composer.*` files.

#### Job 1: Run Tests

This job runs [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/index.html) tests using the following steps:

1. **Checkout the code**: It checks out the code from the repository.
2. **Setup PHP**: It sets up PHP 8.3 and installs the necessary PHP extensions.
3. **Cache Composer packages**: It caches the Composer dependencies to speed up future builds.
4. **Install Composer dependencies**: It installs the dependencies defined in `composer.lock`.
5. **Prepare Laravel application**: It copies the `.env.ci` configuration file to `.env` and generates a new Laravel application key using `php artisan key:generate`.
6. **Run tests**: It runs the Laravel tests using `php artisan test`.

##### Example command to run the tests:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test
```

#### Job 2: Run Static Analysis

This job runs [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), a static analysis tool, to check the code for potential issues. The steps for this job are:

1. **Checkout the code**: This step checks out the code from the repository using the `actions/checkout@v4` action.
2. **Setup PHP**: This step uses `shivammathur/setup-php@v2` to set up PHP 8.3 and ensure the necessary PHP extensions are available for the analysis.
3. **Cache Composer Packages**: To speed up subsequent runs, this step caches the Composer dependencies located in the `vendor/` directory. This prevents the need to reinstall dependencies on every run and helps to optimize build times.
4. **Install Composer dependencies**: This step installs the projectâ€™s Composer dependencies, including the PHPStan extension installer, which is required for running PHPStan.
5. **Run Static Analysis with PHPStan**: This step runs PHPStan, scanning the codebase for issues related to code quality, potential bugs, and type errors. The results are output in a GitHub-compatible format.

##### Example command to run PHPStan:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test ./vendor/bin/phpstan
```
